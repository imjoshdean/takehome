This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Preface

In the interest of transparency, I went over on time a little bit. I needed to spend some time writing the backend because the documentation URL was down at the time of development.

## Running project

Running this project involves running both a backend server as well as the the application itself. You should still only need to execute `npm start`; however, you will need to make sure ports `8081` and `3000` are available.

If you wish you run only one or the other you can do this with either `npm run start-react` or `npm run start-server` for the front end or backend, respectively.
